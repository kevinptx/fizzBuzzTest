The Common FizzBuzz Problem:
  Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 15.
  For multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number. To test multiples of 3, I set i modulo 3 equal to zero.
  For the multiples of 5 print “Buzz” instead of the number. To test multiples of 5, I set i modulo 5 equal to Zero.
  For numbers which are multiples of both 3 && (and) 5 print “FizzBuzz”. To test both 3 and 5, we combine the 2 above.
  else print the number itself: console.log(i)
